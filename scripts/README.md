# Scripts

These are scripts that I use to copy directly from the server to my local machine.
They may be of use to you.

## copy_from_server.bash

Copies server folders `abet_private` and `abet.asucapstonetools.com` to the local machine.

They are put into untracked `server_clone` directores in the appropriate location (ex. `src/abet_private/server_clone`).

## ssh.bash

A shortcut to ssh directly into the server. Gives command line access.

## Others

I probably won't update these until we finally deploy this to the server.
