# Contributing

Since we have so many people here, I would like to have rules for contributing. We can't all develop on main, so here's the deal:

When working on a feature:

1) create a new branch and work on that feature.
2) Once you're done, create a pull request to merge it into the main branch.
3) Someone will review the PR and merge it

I've never done this workflow before, but I know this is how professionals do it.
